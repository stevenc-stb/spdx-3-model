# pqcClassType

## Summary

The post-quantum cryptographic algorithm enumeration.

## Description

Specifies the type of an post-quantum cryptographic algorithm.

## Metadata

- name: pqcClassType

## Entries

- latticeBased: Security based on hard lattice problems, such as Learning With Errors, Ring-LWE and Module-LWE, or NTRU lattices.
- codeBased: Security based on the hardness of decoding random linear error-correcting codes, such as Goppa codes or quasi-cyclic codes.
- multivariate: Security based on the difficulty of solving systems of multivariate quadratic equations over finite fields.
- hashBased:  Security based on the properties of cryptographic hash functions, such as preimage and collision resistance.  Includes stateful and stateless schemes.
- IsogenyBased: Security based on the difficulty of finding isogenies between elliptic curves.
- MPCInTheHead: Signatures built with the "MPC-in-the-Head" or zero-knowledge proof paradigm.
