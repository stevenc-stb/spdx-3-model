## Summary

The Hardware Profile provides additional metadata that is useful for hardware.

## Description

The Hardware namespace defines concepts related to hardware, including virtual hardware,
supply chain and its characteristics.

## Metadata

- id: https://spdx.org/rdf/3.1.0/terms/Hardware
- name: Hardware

## Profile conformance

For an element collection to be conformant with this profile,
the following has to hold:

1. for every `/Hardware/InstantiatedProcess` there MUST exist exactly one
   `/Core/Relationship` of type `instantiatedBy` having that element as its
   `from` property and a `/Hardware/VirualHardware` as its `to`.
   
2. for every `/Hardware/HBOMPhysical`, if the property `mass` is defined then
   `massUnit` must be defined.

3. for every `/Hardware/HBOMPhysical`, if the properties `dimensions` and
   `centerOfMass` are defined then both `dimensions` and `centerOfMass`
   must have the same `coordinateOrientationType` for x, y, and z.
